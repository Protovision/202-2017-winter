<h1>Lab 1</h1>

<p>
Store all of your files for this lab in a folder named "lab1".
</p>

<p>
In this lab you will create filter programs. A filter reads all of it's input, processes that input, then produces output. You will recreate 2 filter programs that are already available in Bash: nl, for numbering lines and wc, a word counting program. 
</p>

Suppose you have a file named data.txt and it contains the following data:

<code>
The quick brown
fox
jumped over
the lazy dog.
</code>

The nl command numbers the lines coming from it's input. Using the following command in bash:

<code>
nl &lt; data.txt
</code>

Produces the following output:

<code>
     1  The quick brown
     2  fox
     3  jumped over
     4  the lazy dog.
</code>

The wc command gives you the number of lines, words, and characters of the data that it reads. This command:

<code>
wc &lt; data.txt
</code>

Will output:

<code>
4 9 46
</code>

Which means that data.txt contained 4 lines, 9 words, and 46 characters. For this lab you won't have to have your wc implementation count lines or characters, just words. 

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

Create a program that works like the nl command. Name your source file nl.cpp and name your program file nl. 

<h3>Exercise 2</h3>

Create a program that counts the number of words it reads from standard input. Name your source file wc.cpp and name your program file wc.
