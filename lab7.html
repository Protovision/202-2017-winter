<h1>Lab 7</h1>

<p>
Store all of your files for this lab in a folder named "lab7".
</p>

<p>
In this lab we will make a simplified version of the minesweeper game.
</p>

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

<p>
Copy the code you have for the Board class and place it into a file named ms.cpp.
</p>

<p>
Modify <tt>ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp; os, const Board&amp; board)</tt> so that rows and columns are labeled like this:
</p>

<code>
     0  1  2  3  4
  0  .  .  .  .  .
  1  .  .  .  .  .
  2  .  .  .  .  .
  3  .  .  .  .  .
  4  .  .  .  .  .
</code>

<p>
You can use manually insert spaces to os, or you can use the setw function found in &lt;iomanip&gt;. 
</p>

<h3>Exercise 2</h3>

<p>
Create a class named Minesweeper with Board as a public base class. This class will represent a 5x5 grid and it will contain 4 random coordinates of where mines are hidden in the grid. 
</p>

<h3>Exercise 3</h3>

<p>
Implement <tt>void reveal(int row, int col)</tt> as a public member function of Minesweeper. This function will set the character at (row, col) to 'M' if there is a mine at that location, or 'C' there is no mine (C stands for clear).
</p>

<h3>After completing all three exercises:</h3>

Test your class using this main function:

<code>
int main()
{
	Minesweeper ms;
	int row, col;
	int guesses = 0;

	while (guesses &lt; 21) {
		cout &lt;&lt; ms &lt;&lt; endl;
		cout &lt;&lt; "Enter row and column: ";
		cin &gt;&gt; row &gt;&gt; col;
		ms.reveal(row, col);
		if (ms(row, col) == 'M') break;
		++guesses;
	}
	cout &lt;&lt; ms &lt;&lt; endl;
	return 0;
}
</code>

<p>
The game is played by having the player select coordinates. Once 21 coordinates have been selected without encountering a mine, that means the last 4 coordinates are where the mines are at and the player has won.
