<h1>Lab 6</h1>

<p>
Store all of your files for this lab in a folder named "lab6".
</p>

<p>
In this lab you will create and improve on one class named Board. Board will represent an NxN grid of characters where N is specified upon an initialization of this class.
</p>

<p>
All exercises shall be done inside board.cpp
</p>

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

<p>
Start by creating the Board class inside board.cpp. Start with this code and replace the comments with your own code to implement the member functions:
</p>

<code>
class Board {
private:
	vector&lt; vector&lt;char&gt; &gt; data;
public:
	explicit Board(int n)
	{
		/* Resize this-&gt;data to have size NxN and set all character elements to '.' */
	}

	char&amp; operator()(int row, int col)
	{
		/* Return reference to character at (row,col) */
	}

	const char&amp; operator()(int row, int col) const
	{
		/* Read-only version of operator(). Does same as above */	
	}
};
</code>

<h3>Exercise 2</h3>

Add this additional member function:

<code>
void clear();
</code>

<p>
and implement it so that it sets all characters in <tt>this-&gt;data</tt> to <tt>'.'</tt>
</p>

<h3>Exercise 3</h3>

Implement two additional member functions:

<code>
bool operator==(const Board&amp; other) const;
bool operator!=(const Board&amp; other) const;
</code>

<p>
which shall be used for comparing the contents of two boards. operator== returns true if the other board is equal to the current board instance, false otherwise. operator!= returns true if the other board is NOT equal to the current board instance, true otherwise.
</p>

<h3>Exercise 4</h3>

<p>
Overload the insertion operator so that you any Board instance can be displayed on an output stream.
</p>

Add this line right after <tt>class Board {</tt>:

<code>
friend ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp; os, const Board&amp; board);
</code>

<p>
then place the following function outside the class and complete it:
</p>

<code>
ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(ostream&amp; os, const Board&amp; board)
{	
	/* Use the insertion operator on os to write a string representation of board */
	return os;
}
</code>
